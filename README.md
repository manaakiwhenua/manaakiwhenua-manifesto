# The Manaaki Whenua GitHub Manifesto

This repository contains a manifesto as to the intentions, motives, and views of a group of Manaaki Whenua - Landcare Research staff 
who are interested in publication of open code in support of reproducible science.  The intention is that the manifesto will
act as a first point of reference for staff to learn more about and discuss the process and expectations for publishing their code.

We envisage that this manifesto will be a living document that evolves over time to adapt to changes in staff requirements and to respond
to changes in code publishing services.  As such, the manifesto has been written in Markdown, and is held in a repository here such that
it can be updated in the future with new versions published as they are developed.
